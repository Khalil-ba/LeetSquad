two-sum,"Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:

string-to-integer-atoi,"Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.
The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:

Whitespace: Ignore any leading whitespace ("" "").
Signedness: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is '-' or '+', assuming positivity if neither present.
Conversion: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.
Rounding: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be rounded to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be rounded to 231 - 1.

Return the integer as the final result.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""42""
Output: 42
Explanation:

The underlined characters are what is read in and the caret is the current reader position.
Step 1: ""42"" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)

Symbol
Value




I
1


V
5


X
10


L
50


C
100


D
500


M
1000



Roman numerals are formed by appending the conversions of decimal place values from highest to lowest. Converting a decimal place value into a Roman numeral has the following rules:

If the value does not start with 4 or 9, select the symbol of the maximal value that can be subtracted from the input, append that symbol to the result, subtract its value, and convert the remainder to a Roman numeral.
If the value starts with 4 or 9 use the subtractive form representing one symbol subtracted from the following symbol, for example, 4 is 1 (I) less than 5 (V): IV and 9 is 1 (I) less than 10 (X): IX. Only the following subtractive forms are used: 4 (IV), 9 (IX), 40 (XL), 90 (XC), 400 (CD) and 900 (CM).
Only powers of 10 (I, X, C, M) can be appended consecutively at most 3 times to represent multiples of 10. You cannot append 5 (V), 50 (L), or 500 (D) multiple times. If you need to append a symbol 4 times use the subtractive form.

Given an integer, convert it to a Roman numeral.
 
Example 1:

Input: num = 3749
Output: ""MMMDCCXLIX""
Explanation:

3000 = MMM as 1000 (M) + 1000 (M) + 1000 (M)
 700 = DCC as 500 (D) + 100 (C) + 100 (C)
  40 = XL as 10 (X) less of 50 (L)
   9 = IX as 1 (I) less of 10 (X)
Note: 49 is not 1 (I) less of 50 (L) because the conversion is based on decimal places

For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.

remove-element,"Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.
Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.

Custom Judge:
The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int val = ...; // Value to remove
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.
                            // It is sorted with no values equaling val.

int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums
for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

next-permutation,"A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].
While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.
The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.

countAndSay(n) is the run-length encoding of countAndSay(n - 1).

Run-length encoding (RLE) is a string compression method that works by replacing consecutive identical characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the number marking the count of the characters (length of the run). For example, to compress the string ""3322251"" we replace ""33"" with ""23"", replace ""222"" with ""32"", replace ""5"" with ""15"" and replace ""1"" with ""11"". Thus the compressed string becomes ""23321511"".

It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3]
Output: 7, nums = [0,0,1,1,2,3,3,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

Before being passed to your function, nums is rotated at an unknown pivot index k (0 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,4,4,5,6,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 5 and become [4,5,6,6,7,0,1,2,4,4].
Given the array nums after the rotation and an integer target, return true if target is in nums, or false if it is not in nums.
You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0

scramble-string,"We can scramble a string s to get a string t using the following algorithm:

If the length of the string is 1, stop.
If the length of the string is > 1, do the following:
	
Split the string into two non-empty substrings at a random index, i.e., if the string is s, divide it to x and y where s = x + y.
Randomly decide to swap the two substrings or to keep them in the same order. i.e., after this step, s may become s = x + y or s = y + x.
Apply step 1 recursively on each of the two substrings x and y.



Given two strings s1 and s2 of the same length, return true if s2 is a scrambled string of s1, otherwise, return false.
 
Example 1:

Input: s1 = ""great"", s2 = ""rgeat""
Output: true
Explanation: One possible scenario applied on s1 is:
""great"" --> ""gr/eat"" // divide at random index.
""gr/eat"" --> ""gr/eat"" // random decision is not to swap the two substrings and keep them in order.
""gr/eat"" --> ""g/r / e/at"" // apply the same algorithm recursively on both substrings. divide at random index each of them.
""g/r / e/at"" --> ""r/g / e/at"" // random decision was to swap the first substring and to keep the second substring in the same order.
""r/g / e/at"" --> ""r/g / e/ a/t"" // again apply the algorithm recursively, divide ""at"" to ""a/t"".
""r/g / e/ a/t"" --> ""r/g / e/ a/t"" // random decision is to keep both substrings in the same order.
The algorithm stops now, and the result string is ""rgeat"" which is s2.
As one possible scenario led s1 to be scrambled to s2, we return true.

Input: s1 = ""abcde"", s2 = ""caebd""
Output: false

Input: s1 = ""a"", s2 = ""a""

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.
The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0

Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].

Example 3:

""1"" -> 'A'

""26"" -> 'Z'
However, while decoding the message, you realize that there are many different ways you can decode the message because some codes are contained in other codes (""2"" and ""5"" vs ""25"").
For example, ""11106"" can be decoded into:

""AAJF"" with the grouping (1, 1, 10, 6)
""KJF"" with the grouping (11, 10, 6)
The grouping (1, 11, 06) is invalid because ""06"" is not a valid code (only ""6"" is valid).

Note: there may be strings that are impossible to decode.

Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it. If the entire string cannot be decoded in any valid way, return 0.
The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

Explanation:
""12"" could be decoded as ""AB"" (1 2) or ""L"" (12).
